motion eye os:
make it such that people can plug in their own scripts. make it the most modifiable.
what a camera would do. what would people want it to do?

it would capture the images, process it and do whatever stuff they would want and then may be they would want to save it.

basic feature without modular design will require:
capturing the images
motion detection
camera displacement detection
compiling the images (in which motion has been detected) into video footage and then saving them
database of schema (footageID,time,duration)


advance features with modular design:
all above features +

user permissions
Zone alerts (Zone based detection/Intrution detection) => (motion detection in certain areas)
timing Alerts (like motion detection at unusual timings)
Blurring specific zones (may be to maintain privacy)
automatic threshold adjustments based on weather (rain/snow)

optional for now:
Integretion with Home automation
